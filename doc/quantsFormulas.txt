Black Schols Formula -> 
    - Assumption: Constant volatility, no dividends, frictionless markets 
        (no fees), continuous trading, and normal distribution of returns (Geometric Brownian 
        Motion)
    - What it does: calculates the theoretical price of European options
    - what it can be used for: finding an edge on the market an over time should pay off 
        (like casino)


Kamlan Filter ->
    - Assumption: System is (approximately) linear and uncertainty is Gaussian. You specify:
	    a state transition model (how the hidden thing evolves),
	    a measurement model (how your data observes that hidden thing),
	    noise levels Q (process noise) and R (measurement noise).
	- What it does: Produces the best (minimum MSE) estimate of an unobserved state x_t from noisy observations y_t, updating each step via predict → update.
	- What it can be used for:
	    Time-varying beta/alpha estimation (dynamic regression) instead of rolling windows
	    Signal extraction (separating “true” price/factor from microstructure noise)
	    Term structure / yield curve factors (level/slope/curvature as latent states)
	    Tracking spreads in pairs trading / statistical arbitrage as a latent mean
